						:: Wiimote Classic Input Bridge::
		
				Emulates a classic controller through a compatible input device

This project consists mainly of a desktop app which sends formatted joystick data (only Xinput for now) to an arduino which will act as a classic controller through the arduino-wiimote library (https://github.com/denizkoekden/arduino-wiimote).
